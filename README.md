# Rate-of-energy-decay-in-deep-convolutional-neural-networks
Experiments on the energy decay of the propagated signals in deep convolutional networks.

The goal of this repo is to serve a python file, that implements a deep convolutaional network with a certain set of well chosen filters. The user can pass any any image of any size, choose, whether it should be interpreted as a 1-d or a 2-d signal, and finally decide how many layers are desired.
